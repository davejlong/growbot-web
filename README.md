# Growbot::Web

Web app for my Growbot library.

## What is Growbot?

Growbot is a project I started to build a monitoring and management utility for
growing coffee (or anything). It uses an Arduino board with sensors, Raspberry
Pi and various open source technologies to track the environment for the coffee.
