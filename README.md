# Growbot::Web

Web app for my Growbot library.

## What is Growbot?

Growbot is a project I started to build a monitoring and management utility for
growing coffee (or anything). It uses an Arduino board with sensors, Raspberry
Pi and various open source technologies to track the environment for the coffee.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'growbot-web'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install growbot-web

## Usage

Just run `rackup` and open your browser to http://localhost:9292
